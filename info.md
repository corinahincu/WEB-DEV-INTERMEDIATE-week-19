# WHAT IS REACT ?

  - JAVASCRIPT library used to create website

  - Allows us to easily create SINGLE PAGE APPS (SPA's for short), 
  it means that the server needs to send only a single HTML page (index.html) to the browser for the website to run fully and then react takes over and manages the whole website in the browser , including any king of website data or user interactivity such as click events and even routing from page to page.

! if you want to use emmets using react, then u need to add in settings 2 things. So go in settings, write emmet, then find emmet: include languages, and to item add javascript and to value add javascriptreact
